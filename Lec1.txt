Lecture 1 notes (4/4/18):

lc for column list
cat /dev/cputype
cat /dev/cputemp
cat /dev/drivers
we'll use gpio, spi and i2c mostly
gpio - talk to individual pin.. set to high or low
spi - talks to the display devices
i2c - similar to spi.. common for sensor devices.. like accelerometer, light sensor etc
man gpio -- would give details about that driver

/dev/sdM0 - files that reference the data on the SD card
--> data has all of the files
dossrv - read something from dos file system

dossrv -f /dev/sdM0/dos
--> serving #s/dos
(kill dossrv | rc)

#s/dos - can be used to reference the srv

mount /srv/dos /n/9fat
lc /n/9fat


sys/src -- entire source code
sys/src/9 -- source code of OS

bcm - stands for broadcom -- for rasp pi -- OS specific to rasp pi

cd sys/src/9 
mkdir newbcm
cp bcm/* newbcm -- copying all files to newbcm
cd newbcm
put the two updated files into newbcm

cp /n/9fat/^(archbcm2.c armv7.s) .

Now we have to rebuild. Going to build using pi2 

mk clean
mk 'CONF=pi2' -- recompiles the entire OS..which creates a new file 9pi2 (new kernel)

-- btw 5c compiler is for ARM

cp 9pi2 /n/9fat -- copying to dos part of sdcard

fshalt -- halt/complete all operations
ctrl+t ctrl+t r -- reboots plan9
